# Digital Bookcase

An Android tablet app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that showcases digital books.

I always enjoy browsing bookcases while at friends' houses, sometimes just to see what interesting things they're into and what they want to showcase to the world.  Over the last few years, most of my reading is done on my tablet with ebooks and there's no way to show those off.  I had an old tablet lying around that I thought would be perfect to scroll through book covers just like a physical bookshelf.  From that idea, this project was born.

## Phase 1

In phase 1, I'd like to get a working prototype working that has all of the core features I'm looking for including:

- Add books to bookshelf
- Import book covers from an external API
- Have a slideshow of the book covers
- Include a details section that provides a description of the book (from the API)
- Ability to rate the book
- Ability to remove books from the bookshelf

Here is a demo of the app in phase 1:

## Phase 2

- I'd like to improve the slideshow component to be more smooth
- I'd like to improve the user interface so its more attractive to use
- - One really noticeable area here is the titles of my screens are pretty vanilla
- I'd like to include other APIs or sources for book cover images as the Google Books API has pretty awful resolution for book covers.
- more to come
